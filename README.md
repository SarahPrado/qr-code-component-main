## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
Here i learn how to use display-flex
```css
.conteinermain{
    color: black;

    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
   
    background-color:  hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
```
### Continued development

With this challenge i haved learn that i need more practice in the flexbox and in how discover the right size of the conteiners.
